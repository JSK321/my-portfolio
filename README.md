# my-portfolio

This is the starting portfolio in my journey to become a full-stack developer. I aim to update this portfolio with future projects in order to show the coding skills I develop through the UW coding bootcamp.

The basic layout of my portfolio is finished, I will be updating it with more content when I am able to. In the contacts, the submit button is not functioning as I do not have it enabled at the moment. The portfolio page is filled with place holder pictures as I am learning to replace them with projects. The about me page is still a work in progress as it still needs to include details in LinkedIn and a picture.
